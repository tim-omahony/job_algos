# You are given two integer arrays 'a', 'b' and one array of distinct integers 'c'. Your task is to check whether 'b' is the longest contiguous subarray of 'a' consisting only of element from 'c', i.e.
# 1. Each of the elements of b belong to c.
# 2. a contains b as a contiguous subarray.
# 3. b is the longest of the contiguous subarrays of a which satisfy the first two conditions. 
# Return true if all of the above are met, false otherwise. 
# NOTE: if there is a tie for the longest contiguous subarrays of a consisting of elements from c, the answer is still considered true if b is one of these longest contiguous subarrays.
